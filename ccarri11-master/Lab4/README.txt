Lab 4: 
ASCII (HEX or 2SC) to Base 4
CMPE 012 Winter 2019

-------------------------
What was your approach to converting each ASCII input to twoâ€™s complement form?
The approached that I took on was that I derived many of the bits by using lw.
With lw I was able to retrieve the address, and locate a bit with sb command.
In addition I followed the work-flow chart that I created, and pseudo code,
But I noticed that I strayed from time to time with my workflow chart.
I literally broke this process down to its core. In addition a key feature that
Helped get the process started was identifying the bits at the very beginning,
48,49, 120 for X and so on. You really do a lot of ascii review with this program.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned how to implement mips as programming arguments, used two's complement, 
registers, commands such as load word/store word, and many other interesting things. 
In particular I struggled somewhat with this lab, but I was able to implement everything
that I learned from this class like the formula from decimal to base conversion taught
Earlier... This came in handy, and just writing this process out on paper... I was
Able to relatively solve the base 4 problem. I felt that you learned more with trial
and error in this lab. Nevertheless, I'd like to give honorable mention on the importance
Of data, and I now see a new perspective on how data performs. Absolutely wonderful
To understand the core; a layer less I suppose.

Did you encounter any issues? 
Yes, I wasn't able to get binary to add with hex, and hex with binary. I didn't have enough
Time as I had to handle a family medical emergency, and unfortunately
Wound up taking care of my sick relative. However, all had, and it really was
A challenge to get this assignment complete. I guess the most challenging part of it all
Was trying to understand how words were stored in memory, rather yet how to locate
A specific address.

Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I found sleep enjoyable, as I did not get that much of it. However, besides that
I loved the challenge. I worked really hard on this lab with the time given, and 
I have to say that I learned more here at UCSC then anywhere else that I have been
I thought it was cool to load a hex address 0xFFFFFFFF and use this address
To manipulate the data in other registers. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would highly suggest that you start this lab ahead of time.. Now being a repeat
I know this by first hand how difficult these labs can be, but nevertheless
This was the most challenging lab of them all. I would stick to the pseudo code as
Much as possible. Last but not least, take breaks! I felt that I didn't take 
Any, which in return actually hurt my performance in terms of getting the work done

Did you collaborate with anyone on this lab? 
Please list who you collaborated with and the nature of your collaboration.
* A playlist of 10 hours of study music
* Coffee
* And talking to myself countless hours on how something makes since in my head, but not on my screen :|

Other then that, no I didn't.

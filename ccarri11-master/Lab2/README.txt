Lab 2: 
Whack-A-MoleCMPE 012 Winter 2019

-------------------------
What were the learning objectives of this lab?
* 2-1 Mux (needed for my mole logic to determine 2 possible combinations that triggered my 1 select line)!
* 4-bit register and how they work hand and hand with the four bit ripple adder (loop if one must). In particular the D-Latch were you need a low to high to trigger active high, and store the D input at that time and point (aka edge triggered).
* XOR are essential components to my adders and useful!
 
What was your design approach?
My designed approach was as suggested and indicated by the lab... I started with the adder and attached led to each sum out and carry to ensure output accuracy feed of binary sum and carry outs. Once established I proceeded to the four-bit register section, and with the d-latch resource provided on Piazza... I was able to learn how a edge triggered level sensitive D latch functioned by tinkering (notating the outcomes) with inputs/outputs.

Did you encounter any issues?
There was a lot of trial and error with the mole logic and four bit register process. More so how the 4-bit register functioned.
In particular, I spent an entire days work getting the bits to decrement, and found out later that my mole logic was incorrect due to it only responding to the whack and mole being 1 & 1.. A s
Thanks to Piazza, someone suggested that I implement a 2-1 Mux, and that solved my problem right away! Should of asked a day earlier.

Were there parts of this lab you found
enjoyable?
Finishing..! Literally the joy of building a small game in the amount of time is a wonderful achievement.. Lets not forget the following:
* How bits work in 2's Complement
* Mux Functionality and purpose
* 4 bit adders
* 4 Bit Registers

All fun, but yet daunting. Thank you for learning experience!

How would you redesign this lab assignment to make it better?
Make it a group project and have it interact with two users... Like a battle ship game of some sort or tic tac toe with LEDs

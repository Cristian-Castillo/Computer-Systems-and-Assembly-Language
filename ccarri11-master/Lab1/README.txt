What did you learn in this lab?
After thirteens hours of staying up to finish this on a Monday morning at 0700am... I have never felt more satisfied in my life! I learned about NAND gates, particularly three NAND gates make an OR gate and Two NAND gates make an AND Gate. I also learned that you can build anything out of NOTS,AND, and OR gates. Once again, let me reiterate that you can also build anything out of NAND Gates only, or NOR gates... Which was pretty cool. I also learned (intuitively) how to make a logical if statement in a sense with b-led light. I just utilized SOP and a little bit of manipulation, but it was rather moderate in terms of difficultly. The irony was that I did part C first, which helped me with the rest of the project. Needless to say, I also learned that three NOR gates make an AND gate. In conclusion I learned about MMLogic and how to develop circuits using SOP to implement these complex circuits (very cool again--addicted stayed up 13 hours)! Thank you so much it was a pleasure!

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Having knowledge of DeMorgan's Law worked well, but also the Sum of Products got me through a lot of the tedious logic circuits. Helps to write out the midterms, and then draw the circuits on a piece of paper before actually implementing them. Also test out each circuit as you build, ensures accuracy!

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would say that this was a rather challenging lab, but the instructions are somewhat vague.Perhaps the Lab manuals could be more precise on implementation.
